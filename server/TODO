SERVERS
-------

Two server types:
1) Master control server (CONTROL)
2) Multiple relay servers which the clients connect to (RELAYS)

When CONTROL sends data to a RELAY, the relay should respond with the number of open connections, and possibly the last messaging rate (messages per second) from the previous message sent.

CONTROL should keep track of of this info, and send this data to clients for load balancing purposes.

CONTROL should also send via the relays a ping if no data sent within 30 seconds.

approaches?
* take fd out of epoll queue after first read?  we won't need more data than this and it might prevent a DOS attack with lots of connections sending a lot of data.


CLIENTS
-------

* If no data received in 45 seconds, something is wrong.  Remove server from pool and try again.

FIREWALL
--------

* Only allow 5 simultaneous connections per IP.
